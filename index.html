        <h2><i>After 1 Hour</i></h2>
        <p class="block">
          In as little as 20 minutes after the last cigarette is smoked, the
          heart rate drops and returns to normal. Blood pressure begins to drop,
          and circulation may start to improve.

        <p class="block3">
          Cigarettes contain a lot of known toxins including carbon monoxide, a
          gas present in cigarette smoke. This gas can be harmful or fatal in
          high doses and prevents oxygen from entering the lungs and blood. When
          inhaled in large doses in a short time, suffocation can occur from
          lack of oxygen. After just 12 hours without a cigarette, the body
          cleanses itself of the excess carbon monoxide from the cigarettes. The
          carbon monoxide level returns to normal, increasing the body’s oxygen
          levels.

        <h2><i>After 1 Day</i></h2>
        <p class="block3">
          Just 1 day after quitting smoking, the risk of heart attack begins to
          decrease. Smoking raises the risk of developing coronary heart disease
          by lowering good cholesterol, which makes heart-healthy exercise
          harder to do. Smoking also raises blood pressure and increases blood
          clots, increasing the risk of stroke. In as little as 1 day after
          quitting smoking, a person’s blood pressure begins to drop, decreasing
          the risk of heart disease from smoking-induced high blood pressure. In
          this short time, a person’s oxygen levels will have risen, making
          physical activity and exercise easier to do, promoting heart-healthy
          habits.

        <p class="block3">
          Smoking damages the nerve endings responsible for the senses of smell
          and taste. In as little as 2 days after quitting, a person may notice
          a heightened sense of smell and more vivid tastes as these nerves
          heal.

          3 days after quitting smoking, the nicotine levels in a person’s body
          are depleted. While it is healthier to have no nicotine in the body,
          this initial depletion can cause nicotine withdrawal.

          In as little as 1 month, a person’s lung function begins to improve.
          As the lungs heal and lung capacity improves, former smokers may
          notice less coughing and shortness of breath. Athletic endurance
          increases and former smokers may notice a renewed ability for
          cardiovascular activities, such as running and jumping.

        <p class="block2">
          Nine months after quitting, the lungs have significantly healed
          themselves. The delicate, hair-like structures inside the lungs known
          as cilia have recovered from the toll cigarette smoke took on them.
          These structures help push mucus out of the lungs and help fight
          infections. Around this time, many former smokers notice a decrease in
          the frequency of lung infections because the healed cilia can do their
          job more easily.

          One year after quitting smoking, a person’s risk for coronary heart

          Cigarettes contain many known toxins that cause the arteries and blood
          vessels to narrow. These same toxins also increase the likelihood of
          developing blood clots. After 5 years without smoking, the body has
          healed itself enough for the arteries and blood vessels to begin to
          widen again. This widening means the blood is less likely to clot,
          lowering the risk of stroke. The risk of stroke will continue to
          reduce over the next 10 years as the body heals more and more.

          After 10 years, a person’s chances of developing lung cancer and dying
          from it are roughly cut in half compared with someone who continues to
          smoke. The likelihood of developing mouth, throat, or pancreatic
          cancer has significantly reduced.

          After 15 years of having quit smoking, the likelihood of developing

          the risk of developing pancreatic cancer has reduced to the same level
          as a non-smoker.

          who has never smoked in their life. Also, the risk of developing
          pancreatic cancer has reduced to that of someone who has never smoked.
